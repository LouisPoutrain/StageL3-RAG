Misnaming DNA sampling is also problematic for assessing impact on animals, identifying opportunities for refinement, and for judging the validity and quality of the data collected. Using more precise terminology could also help scientists realise that they may have been using invasive methods after all, and encourage them to consider reducing the impact of their sampling and/or search for truly non-invasive alternatives.

We define 'non-disruptive DNA sampling' as obtaining DNA from an organism without affecting its fitness, or causing any behaviour or welfare impact that may last longer than the duration of the sampling (Table"
