[SECTION] method
We conducted a keyword-based search on the Web Of Science core collection using the keywords DNA and non-invasive or DNA and noninvasive, as both spellings were originally proposed and are in common use (Taberlet et al., 1999;Taberlet & Luikart, 1999). We restricted our search to articles published in relevant disciplines and between 2013 and 2018. The search command used was the following:
(TS=((dna AND non-invasive) OR (dna AND noninvasive)) AND SU=(ecology OR zoology OR ornithology zoology OR ornithology OR ecology OR environmental sciences OR entomology OR fisheries OR behavioural science OR Biodiversity & Conservation) AND PY= (2013OR 2015OR 2017OR 2014OR 2016OR 2018))
The results from these searches were used as non-exhaustive but comparable numeric estimates only, and were therefore not further curated. The abstract and the method section of each papers were carefully screened to check whether the methods used complied with the original definition proposed by Taberlet et al. (Taberlet et al., 1999) or not. A middle-ground category, labelled as "potentially affecting territory", was created for cases where faecal samples were taken from wild animals that are known to use dejections as territory or social marking. We excluded from this category, studies that specifically mentioned only partial collection of faeces. Where multiple methods were used in the same study, these were classified as compliant with the definition by Taberlet et al. only if all the methods used were compliant or if invasive sampling methods were clearly identified from non-invasive ones. The latter required screening of the whole paper.
Statistical analyses were conducted with R(R Core Team, 2018) (version 3.6) and RStudio(RStudio, 2017) (version 1.2.1335). Packages used included stats, googleVis and bipartite. Statistical significance was set at 5%.

[SECTION] what non-invasive dna sampling is used for
Our systematic review captured 380 articles for which samples were collected from 96 different countries on all continents except mainland Antarctica (Fig 1a). The number of papers detected per year was stable between 2013 and 2018 (X2 = 4.421, df = 5, p-value = 0.4877). The sampling methods used varied between 2013 and 2018 (X2 = 39.754, df = 25, p-value = 0.03091), with in particular an increase in the use of eDNA (Fig 1b).
Among the studies captured in our review, 40% aimed at identifying organisms at the species level, for example to produce biodiversity inventories, or at the individual level (Fig 1c). The latter was often conducted in the context of Capture Mark Recapture (CMR) studies (e.g. (Roy et al., 2014)), where it is essential to identify individuals. Individual genotyping was also often attempted to measure genetic diversity or for population genetic studies (e.g. (Sugimoto et al., 2014)) in 15% of the reviewed articles. The development of new protocols where the quality of the DNA obtained non-invasively was the center of interest was the aim in another 14% of the studies. Other recurrent foci were on the detection of presence (12%), the study of animals' diet (7%) or the sexing of individuals (5%).
The type of samples collected varied widely and 30 different categories were recorded. However, a large number of the studies focused on faecal samples collected as eDNA (48%) (Fig 1c). Another 19% of studies were based on the collection of more than one type of samples, often including faeces. Hair samples, water samples and feathers were the next most represented sample types in our dataset (10%, 6% and 3% of studies respectively). Hair samples were mainly collected through DNA trapping, while feather and water samples were generally collected using an eDNA approach. We also uncovered a variety of much more atypical sample types such as insect pupal cases, urine, fingernails, placenta, mucus etc.
Overall, the substantial majority of sampling methods (71%), were based on the collection of eDNA, while DNA trapping was rarely used (10%). Other cases included studies using several different methods (11%) and few very specific cases (Fig 1c). For example, invertebrates such as leeches (Weiskopf et al., 2018) and carrion flies (Calvignac-Spencer et al., 2013) were used to sample the DNA of the species on which they feed (Fig 1c). More surprising, a number of studies only used non-lethal (but invasive) or even lethal sampling methods (8% of the reviewed papers). Such methods are in breach of the definition of noninvasive DNA sampling as proposed by Taberlet et al.(Taberlet et al., 1999). In fact, 58% of reviewed papers using the phrase "non-invasive" or "noninvasive" did not comply with this definition (Fig 2a) even when this phrase was present in the title of the article (59% of non-complying articles). b: Countries of origin of the samples analysed in the reviewed papers.

Dark colours correspond to papers where the phrase "noninvasive" was present in the title, lighter colours correspond to papers where the phrase "non-invasive" was not present in the title.

Top: compliance with the common definition of a non-invasive medical or veterinary procedure, (i.e. one not involving puncture of the skin or other entry into the body ((&NA;, 1993)). Bottom: compliance with the definition of non-invasive DNA sampling proposed by Taberlet et al. ((Taberlet et al., 1999)). Orange boxes (labelled as "Potentially Not") correspond to cases where territory marking and social interactions may have been affected by the removal of faecal samples.

[SECTION] dna collection and the non-invasive misnommer
Subsequent to its original definition, the term non-invasive has often been misapplied in the literature (Garshelis, 2006). In practice, so-called 'non-invasive' methods have often encompassed DNA collection techniques that preserve the physical integrity of an organism but have an unmeasured, and potentially significant, impact on the fitness, behaviour or welfare of the subject being studied. For example, the following DNA collection methods were all defined as 'non-invasive' by the respective authors: gentle pressure applied to the thorax and abdomen of carabid beetles (Poecilus cupreus) to trigger regurgitation (Waldner & Traugott, 2012); flushing of sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) from their roost sites to collect fresh faecal pellets (Baumgardt et al., 2013); and trapping, handling and cloacal swabbing of lizards (Phrynosoma cornutum) (Williams et al., 2012). Misleading use of terminology in biology and ecology is a longstanding concern (Murphy & Noon, 1991;Hodges, 2008;Herrando-Perez et al., 2014). To demonstrate the extent of the issue, we conducted a systematic review of the recent literature (2013-2018) and evaluated how well papers using the term "non-invasive DNA sampling" complied with the original definition by Taberlet et al. (Taberlet et al., 1999).
When the terminology for DNA sampling is misapplied as being non-invasive when it is not, readers unfamiliar with the scientific literature on DNA sampling (e.g. decision makers, conservation managers, and other end-users), may be misled in thinking that the described method can be applied without affecting the fitness nor behaviour of the target animals. Misnaming DNA sampling is also problematic for assessing impact on animals, identifying opportunities for refinement, and for judging the validity and quality of the data collected. Using more precise terminology could also help scientists realise that they may have been using invasive methods after all, and encourage them to consider reducing the impact of their sampling and/or search for truly non-invasive alternatives. The main issues exposed by our literature search are summarised in Box 1.

[SECTION] box 1: the seven sins of non-invasive dna sampling sin 1: taxonomic bias
One conspicuous result from our review was that only 18 studies (~6% of the reviewed papers) focused on invertebrates compared to 356 focusing on vertebrates (Fig 2b). This striking imbalance implies that noninvasive methods are rarely considered for sampling invertebrate DNA. When authors claimed to use noninvasive DNA sampling on invertebrates, they failed to do so in 55% of the cases (Fig 2d), and even used methods that alter the physical integrity of the organism in 10% of the cases. For example, Rorat et al. (Rorat et al., 2014) collected individual earthworms, which they then electrified "lightly" to induce coelomic secretion. Yet, truly non-invasive methods exist for invertebrates, for example through field collection of insect exuviae (Quynh et al., 2017), pupal cases (Richter et al., 2013), empty mummies (Lefort et al., 2017), dust (Madden et al., 2016) , soil (Bienert et al., 2012), or water samples (Mächler et al., 2014).The misuse of the term non-invasive DNA sampling also varies in relation to the taxonomic group of interest within vertebrates (Fig 2d) (X 2 = 190.69,  df = 30, p < 2.2e-16). For example, 27% of the studies on fish involved alteration of the physical integrity of the organism. These included fin clipping in eels (Anguilla anguilla) (Baillon et al., 2016) and sting amputation in rays (Aetobatus narinari) (Janse et al., 2013) which were both considered non-invasive because these body parts can regenerate, despite the fact that fin clipping is known to be painful for fish (Roques et al., 2010).In comparison, less than 4% of the studies focusing on mammals, involved biopsies.

[SECTION] sin 2: misclassification of faeces as non-invasive dna samples
The majority of the literature on non-invasive DNA sampling included the collection of faecal samples (62% of all studies reviewed here). Faecal collection is very prevalent in the field and assumed to be non-invasive by most authors. However, our analysis shows that 47% of the studies focusing solely on faecal sampling did not comply with the original definition of non-invasive DNA sampling. This included detection of animals and collection of faecal samples using aircraft (e.g. (Roffler et al., 2014)), which may increase stress in animals (e.g. (Ditmer et al., 2015)) or cases where animals were being held in captivity (e.g. (Woodruff et al., 2016)), specifically captured to obtain faecal samples (e.g. (Brown et al., 2017)). For example, Jedlicka et al. (Jedlicka et al., 2016) "extracted DNA from noninvasive fecal samples" of Western Bluebirds (Sialia mexicana) by catching adults and placing them in brown paper bags. Despite focusing on faecal samples, these procedures do not fit the definition proposed by Taberlet et al. (Taberlet et al., 1999). The central misconception, here is that there is no such thing as "non-invasive DNA samples". Rather than the type of sample, it is the method of sampling that needs to be scrutinized for its invasiveness. Another key issue with faecal sampling is that many animals mark their territory using faeces to dissuade potential intruders (e.g. in wolf communities, see (Llaneza et al., 2014)) and also use such marks to recognise individuals from neighbouring territories, avoid unnecessary conflict and promote non-agonistic social encounters such as mating. Therefore, even when collected opportunistically after the animal has left, faecal sampling can in some cases affect the marking behaviour of territorial species (e.g. (Brzeziński & Romanowski, 2006)) (Fig 2a).

[SECTION] sin 3: baiting dna traps
In most studies using a DNA trapping strategy (90%), researchers employed bait or lures to increase the yield of their traps. Very few studies used non-lured DNA traps, for example, barb wire placed at sites used by brown bears (Ursus arctos) (Karamanlidis et al., 2014;Quinn et al., 2014) or modified body snares at otter (Lontra canadensislatin) latrine sites, to collect hair (Godwin et al., 2015). Although it seems perfectly legitimate (and often essential) to increase the attractiveness of DNA traps with food (Cohen et al., 2013), scent marks from other individuals (Anile et al., 2012) or other attractants (e.g. Valerian essence for cats) (Steyer et al., 2013), the animal's behaviour will obviously be modified as a consequence and therefore, these methods cannot be considered fully non-invasive sensu Taberlet et al. (Taberlet et al., 1999).

[SECTION] box 1: the seven sins of non-invasive dna sampling (continued) sin 4: combining invasive and non-invasive methods
In a few examples the impact of the sampling strategy on animal behaviour is obvious from the article's title itself, for example when baited traps are mentioned (e.g. (Steyer et al., 2013)). However, in many more papers (n=35) confusion arises because authors used the phrase "non-invasive sampling" or "non-invasive DNA sampling" while a variety of sampling techniques were actually applied, some of which were non-invasive and some of which were invasive sensu Taberlet et al. (Taberlet et al., 1999). This lack of clarity about what is noninvasive and what is not can be misleading for the reader. Some authors clearly stated the invasiveness of the different methods used (e.g. (Dai et al., 2015;Yannic et al., 2016;Cullingham et al., 2016)), however, most papers where mixed DNA sampling strategies were applied did not specify which of these methods were considered non-invasive.
Another facet of this issue arises when tools (e.g. new primers, extraction protocols, DNA conservation methods) are developed specifically for analysing samples collected non-invasively but are actually tested only (or partly) on samples that were collected invasively (n=17) for example by capturing animals to perform the sampling (e.g. (Barbosa et al., 2013;Malekian et al., 2018)). It is essential in such cases that authors fully acknowledge the invasiveness of the sampling method(s) they used. Often this is not clearly specified.

[SECTION] sin 5: a bird in the hand is no better than two in the bush
Trapping and restraint of wild animals is recognised as a significant stressor that can result in distress, injury, and death (e.g. (Ponjoan et al., 2008)). Capturing and/or handling animals for DNA sampling was observed in 24% of all articles reviewed here (Fig 2c), despite the clear definition given by Taberlet et al. (Taberlet et al., 1999) that non-invasive DNA is "collected without having to catch or disturb the animal". Indeed, capture and/or handling of individuals to obtain DNA samples (e.g. saliva swabbing) can induce long-lasting stress effects (Harcourt et al., 2010;Seguel et al., 2014), and there are very few cases where capturing an animal might have no effects on its future behaviour. Therefore, when animals must be held captive, transported or restrained in order to perform DNA sampling, the method cannot meet the definition of non-invasive DNA sampling sensu stricto (Taberlet et al., 1999). Skin swabbing of octopus (Enteroctopus dofleini) for example (Hollenbeck et al., 2017), is unlikely to be possible in the wild without disturbing the animal and the potential negative impacts on animal welfare (see (Fiorito et al., 2015) for a review on cephalopod welfare) must still be recognised. Another common scenario where the animals are held during DNA sampling relates to the use of museum specimens or animals that were killed for other purposes (n=4). Whether they were legally hunted or poached and confiscated (e.g. (Li et al., 2017)), this type of sampling does not qualify as non-invasive due to the disturbance and/or death of the animal through human activity. Often, a better term for such sampling is "nondestructive", which does not damage the specimen (Wisely et al., 2004;Porco et al., 2010) (Table 1). On the other hand, tissue sampling from animals that were found dead of natural causes is analogous to eDNA left behind by a free ranging animal and can be considered non-invasive (e.g. (Koczur et al., 2017)). It should be noted, however, that opportunistic sampling from animals already killed for other purposes (e.g. culling, museum samples) may be an ethical option because it reduces the need to otherwise target living animals and conforms to the principle of Reduction (reducing the number of affected animals) under the 3Rs framework.

[SECTION] box 1: the seven sins of non-invasive dna sampling (continued) sin 6: all or nothing
Only 42% of the reviewed studies fully met the criteria of the original definition of non-invasive DNA sampling. In most cases, however, authors tried to minimise the impact of sampling, but the nature of the definition proposed by Taberlet et al. (Taberlet et al., 1999) leaves no middle ground between invasive and non-invasive sampling methods. One potential solution to this is to use the term "minimally-invasive DNA sampling", which can be defined as obtaining DNA with minimised effects on the animal's structural/physical integrity, and potential impact on the behaviour and welfare of the organism (Table 1). In our dataset, this term was used in six studies to qualify skin swabbing of fish (Monteiro et al., 2014), amphibians (Ringler, 2018) and bats (Player et al., 2017), feather plucking of gulls (Jones & Kennedy, 2015), cloacal swabbing in rattlesnakes (Ford et al., 2017) and ear biopsies in rodents (Barbosa et al., 2017). A broader use of this term would lead to more accurate reporting, for which potential impacts of the sampling are acknowledged, while still emphasising the aspiration of the authors to minimise those impacts. The challenge associated with the use of such a term would be to define where ambiguities fall between minimally-invasive and invasive sampling methods.

[SECTION] sin 7: equating a non-invasive procedure with non-invasive dna sampling
The lack of perceived stress or pain experienced by an animal is often used as a criterion to support the classification of a method as non-invasive. For example, du Toit et al. (du Toit et al., 2017) stated that "Pangolin scales consist of non-living keratin, therefore taking scale clippings is considered to be non-invasive". This statement relates to the common definition of a "non-invasive" medical or veterinary procedure, i.e. one that does not involve puncture of the skin or other entry into the body (&NA;, 1993). This definition (rather than the one by Taberlet et al. (Taberlet et al., 1999)) seems to be the one adopted by most authors (93% of the reviewed papers complying) (Fig 2d). This was also the case for several articles at the frontier between medical/veterinary fields. Kauffman et al. (Kauffman et al., 2014) for example, called the sampling of vaginal swabs and urine from captive dogs non-invasive. Similarly, Reinardy et al. (Reinardy et al., 2013) designated as 'non-invasive' a procedure consisting of "lightly anaesthetizing fish and applying a slight pressure on their abdomen to expel sperm", which was then used for DNA analysis. These examples were rare in our dataset (n=3) probably because of our strict selection of articles from non-medical and non-veterinary domains (see selected fields in section 2). Nonetheless, as science becomes increasingly transdisciplinary and genetic methods developed in neighbouring fields are used in ecology, this type of confusion is likely to become more prevalent in the future. The discrepancy with the common definition of a non-invasive procedure comprises a significant limitation of the phrase non-invasive DNA sampling as defined by Taberlet et al. (Taberlet et al., 1999), and importantly, could minimise the perceived impacts of sampling methods on animal welfare, even if these impacts are significant in reality. Although this issue was first highlighted in 2006 by Garshelis who stated that: "the term noninvasive has 2 distinct meanings, 1 biological and 1 generic, which have become intertwined in the wildlife literature" (Garshelis, 2006), the confusion continues to riddle the current literature.

[SECTION] introducing the terms non-disruptive and minimally disruptive dna sampling
In order to clarify some of the existing discrepancies exposed by our literature review, we propose the introduction of the term, 'non-disruptive DNA sampling'. This term emphasises the effects of the sampling method not on the physical integrity/structure, but on the fitness and behaviour of the organism from which the sample is obtained. We define 'non-disruptive DNA sampling' as obtaining DNA from an organism without affecting its fitness, or causing any behaviour or welfare impact that may last longer than the duration of the sampling (Table 1). We define 'minimally disruptive DNA sampling' as any sampling method that minimises impacts on fitness, behaviour and welfare. Non-disruptive DNA sampling can be differentiated from 'non-invasive DNA sampling' which in the current literature, largely focuses on whether the method of sampling impacts physical structures of the animal (Fig 2d). The introduction of 'nondisruptive DNA sampling' terminology provides a functional term that appropriately focuses on the impact to the individual and not on a specific quality of the methodology (e.g. whether a physical structure is altered). We acknowledge that very few current DNA sampling methods may be entirely non-disruptive, and recommend that researchers aim at minimising disruption through protocol refinement. This could be achieved by testing the potential effects of different DNA sampling methods on survival, stress, behaviour and reproductive success as proxies for fitness. In order to make our intended meaning clear, we overlaid existing DNA sampling terms in relation to non-disruptive DNA sampling methods in the following paragraphs and in Figure 3. Rather than debating and refining existing terms, the essential point of Figure 3 is to distinguish between disruptive methods, which are likely to cause lasting effects on the behaviour, welfare or fitness of an organism, and non-disruptive ones, which do not.

[SECTION] impact of dna sampling on behaviour, fitness and welfare
Studies examining the effect of DNA sampling on behaviour, fitness and welfare are rare and their results are not always predictable. For example, the fitness consequences of DNA sampling methods, often measured using individual survival as a proxy for fitness (e.g. (Michael & Kirsten, 2004;Oi et al., 2013;Marschalek et al., 2013)), depends on the taxa sampled. Responses may vary strongly between species (Hamm et al., 2010) and even between males and females of the same species. For instance, Vila et al. (Vila et al., 2009) showed that the non-lethal but invasive DNA sampling through leg or hind wing clipping had an effect on survivorship and reproductive behaviour of adult males of the protected moth Graellsia isabelae, while mid leg clipping had a negative impact on female mating success.  Proffitt et al., 2015)), biopsy on handled invertebrate ( (López et al., 2007)).
In particular cases, procedures to obtain DNA samples can also increase the fitness of animals. For example, supplementary feeding can have a direct positive impact on the fitness of birds (Doerr et al., 2017), and this may occur when animals are attracted to DNA traps baited with food or feeding cages where animals are caught for DNA sampling (e.g. (Brekke et al., 2011)). In mammals, remote DNA sampling using biopsy darts is known to cause little reaction from marine mammals when conducted correctly and is unlikely to produce long-term deleterious effects (Bearzi, 2000). Gemmell and Majluf (Gemmell & Majluf, 1997) found that in most cases New Zealand fur seals (Arctocephalus forsteri) recoiled from the impact and searched briefly for the assailant, but never abandoned their territory following the darting. Another study found that bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops spp) reacted similarly to the darting process regardless of being hit or not, suggesting that the reaction is mainly caused by 'unexpected disturbance' rather than biopsy (Krützen & Barré, 2002). No sign of long term altered-behaviours was observed, including probability of recapture. Despite this, all biopsy sampling involves some level of risk (Bearzi, 2000), and different individuals from the same species may react differently to similar stressful situations depending on gender (Brown et al., 1991) or individual physiological and psychological factors (Barrett-Lennard, 1996;Gauthier & Sears, 1999). With regards to animal welfare, Paris et al. (Parris et al., 2010) assessed the impact of different DNA sampling methods on individual welfare in frogs. They concluded that capture and toe clipping was significantly worse than capture and buccal swabbing in terms of the level of suffering experienced by an animal, and the detrimental impacts on survival. These examples illustrate that the level of disruptiveness of DNA sampling methods should be made cautiously and studies assessing their impact on fitness, behaviour and welfare should be encouraged prior to their use.

[SECTION] examples of non-disruptive or minimally disruptive dna sampling
Non-disruptive DNA sampling comprises all non-invasive DNA sampling sensu stricto i.e when the DNA is collected without the subjects being aware of the researcher's presence or experiencing any detrimental effects (as suggested in Taberlet & Luikart (Taberlet & Luikart, 1999)). For example, most eDNA sampling and DNA trapping methods do not require researcher and subject to be present at the same time and place. An important point of difference between these two methods is that eDNA is often collected somewhat opportunistically, while DNA trapping allows for strategic spatial distribution of sampling.
Examples of DNA trapping that are non-disruptive include remote plucking or hair trapping by means of unbaited hair snag traps (Magoun et al., 2011;Rovang et al., 2015) or tape (Banks et al., 2003;Henry et al., 2011) placed at well-used runs. Environmental DNA sampling includes field collection of faeces (e.g. (Mannise et al., 2018)) as long as these do not affect territory marking (see section 3.2), DNA collection from footprints in the snow, such as those from the Swedish Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) (Dalén & Götherström, 2007), and from saliva on twigs, such as from ungulate browsing (Nichols et al., 2012). When DNA is collected in the presence of the animal, the effects of sampling can be minimised by avoiding or drastically limiting handling. For example, the swabbing of animals directly in the field with little (Prunier et al., 2012) or no handling (Morinha et al., 2014).
Sampling methods that are non-disruptive have many benefits for conservation science, because they are unlikely to introduce bias or experimental effect or impact on animal welfare. However, they may be limited in their applicability. The main limitations associated with eDNA and DNA trapping include low DNA quantity and quality (Uno et al., 2012), as well as potential contamination from non-target species (Collins et al., 2012). Another limitation of DNA trapping might be the mixture of DNA from several different target individuals. In such instances, next-generation sequencing (NGS) or other post-PCR analysis (e.g. cloning, single stranded conformation polymorphism, high resolution melting, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) might be required to differentiate and identify the DNA of each individual.
A shift in focus from sampling methods that aim at avoiding breaches to physical structures of an organism, to non-disruptive or minimally disruptive methods, (avoiding impact on behaviour, fitness or welfare), means in some cases the most appropriate method may be invasive but results in a lower impact on the animal. For example, invertebrate antenna clipping in the natural environment breaches a physical structure but may result in no effects on survival (e.g. (Oi et al., 2013)) and may have lower impacts than collecting and removing specimen to captivity for faecal sampling or forced regurgitation.
Similarly, remote dart biopsy or flipper notching of marine mammals are often a preferred choice over stressful captures for DNA sampling because they only cause short term effect (if any) on the behaviour of the animal (Pagano et al., 2014;Kowarski, 2014). Under our definitions, hair collection from the environment, unbaited DNA traps, skin swabbing in the field or remote darting on wild sea mammals could be considered non-or minimally disruptive (Fig 3).

[SECTION] when is non-disruptive dna required or preferred?
The selection of a DNA sampling method is usually a compromise between minimising welfare and ethical costs, and obtaining a quality DNA sample. DNA sampling methods where the specimen is in hand generally results in fresher and better-quality DNA, despite the potentially higher impact on animal behaviour or welfare. While the welfare of all experimental animals should be considered, when the subject is endangered or afforded legal protections there may be additional welfare and/or ethical issues surrounding the use of invasive DNA sampling techniques (Michael & Kirsten, 2004;Boyer et al., 2013). Additionally, the test subject may be required to be alive for further testing or return to their natural habitat. If further tests involve capturing an animal for a laboratory experiment (Lefort et al., 2014) or for translocation (Waterhouse et al., 2014), then the effects of capturing and holding the organisms for DNA sampling are of less concern as individuals will need to be captured for these experiments anyway. However, stressful events can have a cumulative effect (Bateson, 2016), therefore the potential for further exacerbation of stress by DNA sampling should be carefully considered.
The importance of considering non-disruptive DNA sampling also depends on the type of study undertaken. Below we describe experimental studies, field behavioural studies, and capture mark recapture (CMR) research, as three types of situations in which collection and use of non-disruptive DNA samples may be essential.

[SECTION] laboratory-based experimentation
Non-disruptive DNA sampling is necessary for species identification, sexing or genotyping of individuals prior to laboratory-based experimentation where fitness and/or behavioural traits are to be assessed. For example, many species of birds are monomorphic, and can only be sexed using molecular analysis (Vucicevic et al., 2013). Similarly, many cryptic species complexes can only be elucidated genetically (Hebert et al., 2004). Laboratory-based behavioural or fitness studies involving cryptic or monomorphic species may therefore require DNA sexing or species identification of individuals before conducting research on them (Fumanal et al., 2005;Lefort et al., 2014) to ensure a balance of sex or species across different treatments. Even when species identification is not an issue, the organisms being studied may comprise different morphocryptic genotypes (Fumanal et al., 2005) that must be determined prior to experimentation in a way that does not affect their fitness or behaviour. One classical way to alleviate the effects of sampling on behaviour (for example when animals are collected in the wild and brought to the lab), is to allow for a recovery and acclimation period.

[SECTION] behavioural studies in the field
The second major use of non-disruptive DNA sampling is when relatedness between individual subjects must be determined prior to a behavioural study conducted in the field. For example, social interactions in mammals are often linked to kinship and can be mediated by the physiological state of individuals (Creel, 2001). The capture and handling of animals can modify their physiology (Suleman & Wango, 2004), thereby affecting their social behaviour. Recent studies also suggest that although behaviours observed shortly after release may appear 'normal', stress levels may still be high and impact activity budgets (Thomson & Heithaus, 2014). Such effects may remain undetected but have significant implications for subsequent data reliability and validity.

[SECTION] capture mark recapture
The effects of DNA sampling on animal behaviour may also affect the results of studies that are not directly examining behaviour or fitness. The third case when non-disruptive DNA sampling is recommended is when doing Capture Mark Recapture (CMR) studies. CMR studies using DNA tagging are often conducted to estimate population size (e.g. (Robinson et al., 2009)), with the additional benefit of enabling population genetic analysis on the samples collected. Invasive or disruptive DNA sampling techniques may affect the survival rate of marked individuals, or introduce avoidance behaviours, which may cause trap avoidance, and the population size to be overestimated. For example, toe clipping combined with CMR is commonly used to estimate population abundance of amphibians (Nelson & Graves, 2004), but toe clipping has been shown to decrease chances of frog recapture by 4 to 11 % for each toe removed (Michael & Kirsten, 2004). Similarly, sampling methods that may increase the fitness of animals (e.g. feeding cages or baited DNA traps) could lead to previously sampled animals being more attracted than naïve ones (Boulanger et al., 2004;Garshelis, 2006), thereby biasing the CMR results towards underestimating population size.
Such biases can be limited by the use of non-disruptive DNA sampling methods. Although eDNA has been used in CMR studies and is in most cases non-disruptive, it can have some limitations. The presence of mixed DNA samples and the lower quality of the collected DNA can lead to false positives where animals not captured previously are believed to be recaptured due to their DNA profile being indistinguishable from that of captured animals (Lampa et al., 2013). Because of this, non-disruptive DNA sampling may provide an appropriate balance between sample quality, data quality and impact on animals.

[SECTION] take-home messages
1. In practice, most papers using the phrase "non-invasive DNA sampling" only comply to the medical definition of the term non-invasive, which is broader than the original definition proposed by Taberlet et al. (Taberlet et al., 1999) and is concerned only with the preservation of the physical integrity of the organism being sampled. We urge scientists using non-invasive DNA sampling methods to always state whether they refer to the definition by Taberlet et al. (Taberlet et al., 1999) sensu stricto or the medical definition of a non-invasive procedure (sensu lato).
2. We propose the new terms, "non-disruptive" and "minimally-disruptive" DNA sampling, to more appropriately address the potential behaviour, welfare and/or fitness effects of DNA sampling methods, as opposed to physical integrity (invasiveness in the medical sense). We can envisage situations in which the research aims are not impacted by the sampling approach to obtain DNA. However, researchers have an ethical obligation to minimise the impacts on the animals. Therefore, whenever possible, non-disruptive or minimally disruptive DNA sampling methods should be selected, in particular prior to experimental or observational studies measuring fitness or behaviour, as well as studies using techniques such as CMR where fitness or behaviour may affect results.
3. It may in some cases be better to use a physically invasive method (e.g. remote biopsy) that is minimally disruptive rather than a method that does not involve puncturing the skin but causes severe stress and has long-lasting effects (e.g. stressful capture for saliva swabbing).
4. More research is required to better understand the consequences of different live DNA sampling methods on behaviour, welfare and fitness in a variety of animal species and contexts. Table 1. Glossary of terms as used in this review.

[SECTION] field sites and sampling methods' description
Carrion flies were captured at two tropical field sites. The Ta€ ı National Park, Côte d'Ivoire (thereafter Ta€ ı), is the largest remnant block of the Upper Guinean rainforest and a typical example of tropical moist forest. It houses a considerable diversity of mammals. Among these, nine nonhuman primate species can be found, many of which have been studied within the framework of a long-term research programme (Boesch & Boesch-Achermann 2001;McGraw et al. 2007). Kirindy Forest, western Madagascar (thereafter Kirindy), is a tropical dry deciduous forest, hosting a number of mammal species. Eight lemur species occur there, which are the focus of a long-term research programme as well (Kappeler & Fichtel 2012). Flies were either caught under mosquito nets protecting dissection areas or at random forest locations using mosquito nets thrown over a bowl containing a piece of meat or bottle-based traps in which a piece of meat had been placed (Fig. S1, Supporting information). In Ta€ ı, all flies were placed in tubes and stored in liquid nitrogen containers immediately after collection. In Kirindy, flies were placed in tubes filled with 96% ethanol and later stored at À20 °C.

[SECTION] dna extraction
Entire flies were placed in FastPrep ® lysing matrix tubes (MP Biomedicals, Illkirch, France) filled with 250 lL phosphate buffer saline and cut several times with sterilized scissors. Tubes were then placed in a FastPrep ® system and agitated three times for fiveseconds. For individual fly analyses, nucleic acids were extracted from 100 lL fly mixture using the GeneMA-TRIX Stool DNA Purification Kit (Roboklon, Berlin, Germany) according to manufacturer's instructions. Except for 30 Ta€ ı flies, which were extracted by a service provider (GenExpress, Berlin, Germany) to provide an independent proof of feasibility, individual extractions were carried out at the Robert Koch Institute. For the fly pool analysis, 10 lL of each selected mixture was added to the pool and the resulting 300 lL were extracted at once using the same kit as for individual extractions. To assess the efficiency of this protocol in removing PCR inhibitors, the first 40 DNA extracts were used in a quantitative inhibition test. In the latter, quantitative PCR assays aimed at amplifying 1 million copies of a short chicken DNA fragment (a portion of the CXCR4 gene) were led in the presence of 5 lL fly DNA extract. The expected number of initial chicken templates was always derived from the experiments, suggesting fly DNA extracts did not exhibit significant inhibitory effect (data not shown).
Nucleic acids were also extracted from 34 tissue samples which had been obtained from Ta€ ı specimens, either from carcasses or darted specimens (bats, carnivores, artiodactyls, primates and rodents) using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to manufacturer's instructions.
DNA concentrations were measured for all extracts using a Nanodrop device (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).

[SECTION] mammal-targeting pcr assays for carrion fly screening
Three assays targeting taxa of different breadth (chimpanzee, mammals and vertebrates) were used to screen fly DNA extracts. So as to decrease the sensitivity to classical laboratory contaminants such as human or porcine DNA, PCR were performed in the presence of appropriate blocking primers (Vestheim & Jarman 2008). All assays were optimized using a quantitative PCR approach similar to (Boessenkool et al. 2011), which we applied to a panel of 29 DNA extracts obtained from four humans, four other hominoids, nine cercopithecids, one lorisid, five artiodactyls, two rodents, two bats and one pangolin.
The chimpanzee-specific assay targeted a 114 base pair (bp) long fragment of the mitochondrial 16S gene (16S), using the following primers: 16Sape_f 5′-ATT-CTCCTCCGCATAAGCCT-3′, 16Sape_r 5′-GCCTGTGTT GGGTTAACAG-3′ and 16ape_blkhum 5′-TCCGCAT AAGCCTGCGTCAGATTAAAACAC-spacerC3. The panmammal assay targeted a c. 130 bp fragment of 16S. It was derived from the literature (Boessenkool et al. 2011) but was supplemented with a pig blocking primer: 16Smam1 5′-CGGTTGGGGTGACCTCGGA-3′, 16Smam2 5′-GCTGTTATCCCTAGGGTAACT-3′, 16Smam_blk-hum3 5′-CGGTTGGGGCGACCTCGGAGCAGAACCC-spacerC3 and 16Smam_blkpig 5′-CGGTTGGGGT GACCTCGGAGTACAAAAAAC-spacerC3. PCR were also performed using a variant of this system, to determine success rates for a longer fragment. In that case, 16Smam2 was substituted with 16Smam4 5′-AGATAGAAACCGACCTGGAT-3′, resulting in an amplicon length of about 300 bp. Finally, the pan-vertebrate assay targeted a c. 140-bp fragment of 12S. It was also derived from the literature (Riaz et al. 2011;Shehzad et al. 2012), but supplemented with human and pig blocking primers: 12S_V5f 5′-ACTGGGATTAGAT ACCCC-3′, 12S_V5r 5′-TAGAACAGGCTCC TCTAG-3′, 12S_V5_blkhum 5′-TACCCCACTATGCTTA GCCCTAAACCTCAACAGTTAAATC-spacerC3 and 12S_V5_blkpig 5′-TACCCCACTATGCCTAGCCCTAAA CCCAAATAGTTACAT-spacerC3.
PCRs were performed in a total volume of 25 lL and were started with 200 ng DNA (DNA concentration >40 ng/lL) or 5 lL DNA extract (DNA concentration <40 ng/lL). PCR mixes were set-up so as to allow reducing as much as possible carry over contamination with PCR products. They contained 0.2 lM of each primer, 1 lM of each blocking primer, 200 lM dNTP (with dUTP replacing dTTP), 0.3 U AmpErase ® uracil Nglycosylase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 4 mM MgCl 2 , 1X PCR buffer and 1.25 U Platinum ® Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). Cycling conditions were: 7 min at 45 °C, 10 min at 95 °C, 42 (short and long pan-mammal and ape-specific 16S) or 47 (pan-vertebrate 12S) cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 64 °C (short and long pan-mammal 16S), 57 °C (ape-specific 16S) or 60 °C (pan-vertebrate 12S), 1 min at 72 °C and 10 min at 72 °C. PCR products were visualized on an agarose gel and cleaned up using ExoSAP-IT ® (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) before being sequenced in both directions using the Sanger method. All chromatograms were examined using Geneious Pro v5.4.3 (http://www.geneious. com/). A detailed depiction of all experiments performed on all flies used in this study is available as Table S1 (Supporting information).
To provide a further control for contamination, the 30 DNA extracts generated externally were also PCR-amplified by the same service provider (GenExpress). All other PCRs were performed at the Robert Koch Institute.

[SECTION] next-generation sequencing of carrion fly dna amplified with pan-mammal pcr systems
The above-mentioned short and long 16S assays were used to generate amplicons for deep sequencing. For this, 200 ng DNA from the 30-fly-pool DNA extract was used to seed reactions. Two different protocols were tested. Two amplicons (one with each primer pair) were generated according to a modified protocol in which normal primers were replaced with fusion primers and normal dNTP were used. Two additional amplicons were generated using the normal screening protocol (i.e. using normal primers and dUTP-containing dNTP). Those were diluted 50 times and used as template for a further five cycle-long PCR using fusion primers and normal dNTP. This last strategy was implemented as it has recently been shown to limit the biases introduced by fusion primer-based amplification (Berry et al. 2011). The four PCR products were then cleaned using MinElute columns (Qiagen) and their DNA concentration assessed using a Qubit ® fluorometer (Invitrogen). Sequencing of individual amplicons was performed on one-eighth of a pico titre plate using a GS FLX platform, according to manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Sciences, Penzberg, Germany). Reads were filtered using the PRINSEQ v0.19.2 online interface (Schmieder & Edwards 2011). Reads were discarded if <84 and >109 bp (excluding primers) for the short fragment or <220 and >72 bp (excluding primers) for the long fragment and/or if containing one bp with a quality score below ten or exhibiting an average quality score below 15. After filtering, a minimum of 16 470 reads per PCR product was retained for further analysis. Reads were finally clustered using the online tool cd-hit-est (Li & Godzik 2006;Huang et al. 2010) applying two successive similarity thresholds set-up at 97% and 94%. No noticeable difference between PCR protocols could be identified, but the number of PCR products analysed (2 and 2) was obviously way too low to detect anything else than major shifts. For each PCR product, a FASTQ file comprising all raw reads is archived in DRYAD under doi: 10.5061/dryad.57vg4.

[SECTION] taxonomic assignment of mammal sequences
Taxonomic assignment was performed using BLAST (Altschul et al. 1990). Sequences were compared with NCBI's nonredundant database through an online BLAST search and, for sequences generated with the pan-mammal 16S assays, to our own collection of 16S sequences from Ta€ ı mammals through a local BLAST search.
Even taking into account the sequences determined for this study, very few sequences have been determined from mammals living in Ta€ ı. Actually, <60% of the 232 mammal species reported to be present in the entire Côte d'Ivoire have been examined for 16S diversity (as deduced from a search in NCBI's Nucleotide database of all 232 species names). In most cases, these sequences were not even determined from individuals from Côte d'Ivoire. It was therefore impossible to apply stringent identity level thresholds for species or genus identification, as sometimes done for eDNA analyses (e.g. 100% threshold for species identification in Thomsen et al. ( 2012)). Most species identifications (86%) were performed based on 16S sequences. Among those, 76% exhibited identity levels ! 99% (84% considering identity levels ! 98%). As a comparison, chimpanzees and bonobos (Pan paniscus), which are thought to have diverged from each other 2 million years ago (Bjork et al. 2011), exhibit <97% identity for the same region. In these cases where lower identity levels were observed (typically between 94% and 97%), identification was made on a case-per-case basis combining BLAST information (e.g. second hit exhibiting a marked drop in e-value) and available biological information (e.g. phylogenetic relationships or reported presence in the forest). As a test of the validity of our species assignment, we further applied a clustering approach to short 16S sequences using cd-hit-est and a threshold of 95%. This equated all operational taxonomic units with individual species found through BLAST analysis, except for Myonycteris torquata and Hypsignathus monstrosus (which are recently diverged fruit bat species). We are therefore confident that most assignments are correct and, at the very least, that the extent of mammal diversity presented in this article reflects the mammal diversity captured by our sample of flies. All sequences are available as Appendix S1 (Supporting information).

[SECTION] species accumulation curve estimation
Because always several flies were captured in a trap, the detection of species cannot be considered as independent events. We therefore did not fit curves to species detected in individual flies. Instead, we used the 15 'batches' that contained flies captured in one trap. Batch size ranged from 2 to 35 flies and number of detected species ranged from 0 to 10 (the input file used in further analyses is provided as Table S2, Supporting information). We first tried to fit an asymptotic curve (Eggert et al. 2002) to the cumulative number of species S i detected in n flies
where a and b are the parameters to be estimated and x is the cumulative number of flies. We did this by resampling the data set 1000 times without replacement to derive mean values and confidence limits. However, for many resampled data sets, parameters could not be estimated reliably because the fitting algorithm did not converge. This indicated that the asymptotic trend in the resampled data sets was not consistent enough and thus the data set was too small to derive such statistics. We therefore decided to only fit the curve to the mean values of the bootstrapped data (y = 29.38 9 (1 À exp (À0.00899 9 number of flies))). All analyses were performed in R (R Development Core Team 2008).

[SECTION] carrion fly family/species determination
PCR were prepared as above mentioned using a primer pair widely used to target a c. 700-bp COI fragment in invertebrates (Folmer et al. 1994). All reactions were seeded with 50 ng DNA. Cycling conditions were: 5 min at 95 °C, 35 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 50 °C, 1 min at 72 °C and 10 min at 72 °C. PCR products were visualized and sequenced as above mentioned. For assignment to Calliphoridae or Sarcophagidae, we used BLAST (Altschul et al. 1990) and a threshold of 94% identity to published sequences from species belonging to one or the other family (intersubfamilies pairwise distance over this fragment ranged between 7% and 15%). Applying this criterion, 95% sequences could be assigned confidently at the family level. A subset of flies could be determined down to the species level, using a threshold of 99% identity to published sequences.

[SECTION] amplifying mammalian dna from carrion flies with known exposure to carrion
We captured 86 flies (under dissection nets) during necropsies of carcasses from five different mammalian species (Table 1). Using ape-specific, pan-mammal and pan-vertebrate PCR systems targeting short (<170 bp) fragments of the mitochondrial 16S and 12S genes, 60/ 86 flies (70%) were shown to contain amplifiable DNA (Table 1). The corresponding sequences were assignable to the expected species for 54/86 flies (63%), with success rates ranging between 33% and 89% per net (Table 1). In addition to the expected species, DNA of other mammals was detected in 11 flies (13%; Table 1).

[SECTION] assessing mammalian biodiversity using dna from randomly collected carrion flies
We then analysed 115 flies without known exposure to carrion, captured at random locations in Ta€ ı (n = 75) and Kirindy (n = 40). Twenty-nine of 75 flies from Ta€ ı (39%) were found positive for mammalian DNA (Table 2). Mitochondrial 16S and 12S sequences from Ta€ ı identified 16 taxa belonging to the orders Artiodactyla, Chiroptera, Eulipotyphla, Primates and Rodentia (Table 2). Twelve of them were identified to the species level, all of which were known to occur in Ta€ ı. The four remaining taxa were two murinae, one hystricid (porcupine) and one crocidurinae (white-toothed shrew), of which several species occur in Ta€ ı (only two hystricids, many more murinae and shrews). A species accumulation curve derived from all flies captured in Ta€ ı (including flies captured under nets; n = 161) evidenced that increasing sampling size would have resulted in detecting additional mammal species (the small size of the sampling prevented any further prediction; Fig. 1). Seventeen of 40 flies from Kirindy (42%) were found positive for mammalian DNA. Four mammal taxa belonging to the orders Afrosoricidae, Carnivora and Primates were identified; three of them at the species level (Table 2). All were known Malagasy endemics. Two bird species, one in Ta€ ı and one in Kirindy, were also detected with the pan-vertebrate PCR system targeting 12S (Table 2). One amphibian species was detected in Ta€ ı using the pan-mammal PCR system targeting 16S (Table 2). Seven flies (five in Ta€ ı and two in Kirindy) contained DNA from multiple mammal/vertebrate taxa. *Where species identification was not possible, higher taxa to which DNA sequences could be related are shown. Number of flies found positive for a given taxon is given in brackets. †Co-detection with another mammal species. ‡These duiker DNA sequences could not be attributed to species but the observed differences (4/107 bp; 12S fragment) were considered incompatible with them belonging to different individuals of a single species. See also Table S3 (Supporting information).

[SECTION] targeting longer dna fragments
We retested 150 flies using a modified pan-mammal 16S assay, with an amplicon length of 300 bp. Success rates did not change dramatically when compared with results obtained with short fragments: 52/59 flies captured under dissection nets (88%) and 23/91 randomly collected flies (25%) were positive for mammalian DNA (vs. 63% and 40% with short fragments).
Assessing pooling as a high-throughput strategy
We pooled and extracted at once remnants of 30 flies already analysed individually. Two short and two long 16S amplicons were generated from the extract using fusion primers and directly sequenced on a 454 GS FLX. This allowed for the identification of, respectively, 8/12 (first short PCR product), 10/12 (second), 8/9 (first long PCR product) and 8/9 (second) of the taxa identified through individual analyses and Sanger's sequencing (Table 3). A single taxon was detected only through individual sequencing whereas four others were only detected through the pooled fly NGS approach (Table 3).

[SECTION] identifying suitable carrion fly species
Finally, to determine the fly species captured and analysed, we generated COI sequences from 181 flies. In both Ta€ ı and Kirindy, blow flies (family Calliphoridae) were abundant, accounting for over 90% of captured individuals and being found in all traps. A minimum of three species were identified in Ta€ ı (blow fly species identification was not possible for Kirindy flies): Chrysomya inclinata (60 individuals captured in 6 traps), Chrysomya putoria (52 in 14 traps) and Chrysomya albiceps (13 in six traps). Flesh flies (family Sarcophagidae) accounted for the remaining 10% of individuals and were only found in 9/21 traps. A minimum of one species was identified in Ta€ ı (Sarcophaga africana, three in two traps) and in Kirindy (Sarcophaga tibialis, two in two traps In a comparative perspective, an important question is that of invertebrate feeding strategies, which might introduce biases in the mammal spectrum detected. This also applies to carrion flies species, which have sometimes been reported to exhibit host preferences (Norris 1965). In spite of a relatively moderate sample size, our data do not indicate a strong sampling bias related to either average body size or forest strata use of the host species. Both small (<0.1 kg) and large (up to 235 kg) as well as terrestrial and arboreal mammals were identified (Table S3, Supporting information). This might contrast with other invertebrates presenting well-known host preferences (e.g. mosquitoes; Lyimo & Ferguson 2009). It is also worth noting that tsetse flybased studies have not yet detected small-bodied mammals (Konnai et al. 2008;Muturi et al. 2011) and that the presence of only terrestrial mammals was revealed through leeches (Schnell et al. 2012). Although further work is needed to provide a proper comparison, it may be that carrion flies feed on a larger spectrum of mammals than blood-sucking invertebrates.
In the end, it is, however, clear that blow flies, haematophagous insects and leeches should be considered as parts of the same vertebrate sampler toolbox, from which one tool will occasionally supersede the others, depending on the ecosystem investigated or the conceived application. For example, while leeches have a much more restricted distribution than blow flies, it can be expected that they will contain more mammal DNA, for longer periods of time than blow flies, which points at them as ideal candidates for DNA-demanding applications (Schnell et al. 2012).
Carrion fly-derived DNA might be used to address a number of questions related to mammal biodiversity. We show here an example of high-throughput mammal biodiversity assessment using NGS of fly pool DNA. Our experiment provides a picture of mammalian biodiversity that matches closely the one obtained using individual-based methods. This suggests that no strong bias arose from the competition between different species' DNA, as sometimes observed in bacterial metagenomics (Hong et al. 2009). Hence, NGS from fly pools represents a very effective sequencing strategy in terms of laboratory costs and sample usage. The fact that amphibian and bird sequences were also detected suggests that similar strategies may be developed to assess the biodiversity of other animal groups. Nonmammal taxa, however, only formed a small fraction of the vertebrate sequences found here, even when a panvertebrate system was used, so this aspect warrants more investigation. assessment and monitoring of mammalian biodiversity. We are therefore convinced that this new tool will quickly come into use and contribute to the advancement of the DNA-based evaluation of the diversity of wild mammals and other organisms.

Although quantitative (qPCR)-based eDNA sampling typically targets single species, each sample has the potential to provide multispecies occupancy data because a single sample potentially contains DNA of all animals present at or upstream from a location (Thomsen et al., 2012;Valentini et al., 2016). Given the dramatic and recent increase in eDNA surveys for single invasive or rare native species, eDNA sample collections are rapidly accumulating. Using eDNA to detect a single species typically only requires a portion of the total sample. Thus, if samples are properly preserved, archived, and annotated, these eDNA collections represent a trove of biodiversity data accessible at relatively low cost that can be repurposed for additional species.
One rapidly increasing collection of eDNA samples is associated with a range-wide survey for bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus; Young et al., 2017). In this survey, environmental DNA samples were collected by dozens of collaborators throughout the Pacific Northwest and sent to the National Genomics Center for Wildlife and Fish Conservation, at the USDA Rocky Mountain Research Station, Missoula, MT. Here, the samples were extracted, analyzed for bull trout, archived, annotated, and stored in a central repository along with all metadata including sampling dates and locations. The bull trout detection results were then uploaded onto a publicly accessible database (https://www. fs.fed.us/rm/boise/AWAE/projects/BullTrout_eDNA/SurveyStatus. html) that has a user-friendly interface allowing users to extract data associated with specific sampling locations. While this archive provides sample coverage across an extensive area, and therefore the potential to determine the occurrence of many species, the efficacy of repurposing eDNA samples is largely unknown, particularly when sampling strategies were initially designed to maximize detection rates for organisms with very different life histories.
Freshwater mussels are a diverse group of organisms with roughly 300 species native to North America and represent one of the most highly endangered and rapidly declining fauna on Earth (Haag, 2012).
These extinctions and declines are often attributed to anthropogenic activities that impact water quality and foster the establishment of non-native species (Bogan, 1993;Williams, Warren, Cummings, Harris, & Neves, 1993). In addition, freshwater mussels require native fish hosts for reproduction and dispersal, and so, freshwater mussel declines may also be tied to declining or changing fish communities. As declines continue, sensitive and reliable methods to assess distributions of freshwater mussel species are critical for focusing conservation efforts. Traditional mussel surveys are time-intensive and require specialized expertise to provide reliable results, which discourages their application at broad scales. Thus, alternate approaches providing more rapid assessments with equal or greater sensitivity would be a significant contribution to conservation of freshwater mussels.
The western pearlshell mussel (Margaritifera falcata) is a freshwater bivalve native to western North America from California to southern Alaska and east to the headwaters of the Missouri River in Montana, the Snake River in Wyoming, and the Great Basin in Utah and Nevada (Nedeau, Smith, Stone, & Jepsen, 2009). Western pearlshell mussels are benthic organisms that are patchily distributed in low-gradient habitats in clear, cold streams, with densities varying from locally abundant to very rare (Limm & Power, 2011;Stone, Barndt, & Gangloff, 2004). This species has been extirpated or is declining in many portions of its historical range (Nedeau et al., 2009), and intensive surveys to evaluate the distribution of this species have been recommended (Xerces Society, https://xerces.org/western-pearlshell/). Western pearlshell have been shown to emit significant quantities of organic matter likely to contain DNA in the form of feces (Limm & Power, 2011), and other possible sources of DNA may be released during molting, reproduction, mucus production, or decomposition posthumously (Deiner & Altermatt, 2014). However, their benthic habit, localized distribution, and low relative biomass could reduce detection probability with eDNA methods (Stoeckle et al., 2015).
Nonetheless, eDNA analysis has proven to be an invaluable tool for detecting a variety of taxa and has resulted in per site detection efficiencies exceeding traditional methods severalfold (Valentini et al., 2016;Wilcox et al., 2016). Reliable, whole-basin eDNA sampling designs have been developed for other taxa (McKelvey et al., 2016) resulting in an accumulation of archived eDNA. While these samples were collected targeting the DNA of fishes, they likely captured DNA shed by other organisms, including western pearlshell, and could provide all or a significant portion of a western pearlshell survey minimizing the need for additional field effort.
Our primary goal was to design and validate an eDNA assay specific to the western pearlshell. Our secondary goal was to determine whether archived eDNA samples collected for detection of species with very different life histories (in this case, fish) could be repurposed to confirm the presence of western pearlshell at locations of historical occurrence. Ultimately, we demonstrate the utility of maintaining a well-annotated archive of eDNA samples accessible from a central repository.

[SECTION] | methods
We designed an environmental DNA assay specific to western pearlshell in three phases: in silico, in vitro, and in vivo. First, we compiled sequences of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) mitochondrial gene of this species (Mock, Brim Box, Chong, Furnish, & Howard, 2013; Table 1) and 10 other mollusk species (Table 1). We screened the sequences in silico using the DECIPHER package (Wright et al., 2014) in R v. 3.2.3 (R Core Development Team (2015)) and obtained candidate primers unique to western pearlshell. We aligned the primers with sequence data in MEGA 6.0 (Tamura, Peterson, Peterson, Filipski, & Kumar, 2013) and adjusted primer lengths and position in Primer Express 3.0.1 (Life Technologies) to optimize annealing temperatures (Table 2). In addition, we compared the primers to additional western pearlshell sequence data (GenBank accessions AY579126-579128 and DQ272374-272383) and identified a T A B L E 1 Species, sample size (n), and GenBank accession number for DNA sequences used for in silico eDNA marker development. Also included is the minimum number of base pair differences between each component of the eDNA marker and the nontarget sequences *Anodonta californiensis and Anodonta nuttalliana are proposed to be a single species representing one clade of Anodonta, as is the case with Anodonta oregonensis and Anodonta kennerlyi (Chong et al., 2008;Mock et al., 2010). We keep them separate in this table to align with GenBank taxa designations and accessions. single nucleotide polymorphism 12 nucleotides from the 3′ end of the forward primer in four of the published sequences (accessions AY579126, AY579128, DQ272376, and DQ272382). To promote efficient amplification of all western pearlshell specimens, we incorporated a degenerate base (Kwok, Chang, Sninsky, & Wang, 1994;Wilcox et al., 2015) at this position in the forward primer. The resulting primers amplify a 106-nucleotide fragment of the COI gene.

Within this fragment, we visually identified an area unique to western pearlshell and designed a FAM-labeled, minor-groove-binding, nonfluorescent quencher (MGB-NFQ) probe (Table 2) to maximize nucleotide differences with nontarget sequences. We assessed the annealing temperature of the probe in Primer Express 3.0.1 (Life Technologies; Table 2) and examined potential secondary structure formation of the primer-probe set using IDT OligoAnalyzer (https:// www.idtdna.com/calc/analyzer). To confirm the specificity of the western pearlshell assay in silico, we performed BLAST searches on each primer and the probe.
We also evaluated in silico the potential for cross-amplification of common fish associates of the western pearlshell to confirm that these species did not pose the risk of primer competition, potentially limiting the efficacy of the assay. Thus, we compared the primers to genetic sequence data of fish species suggested in Nedeau et al. To test the specificity of the assay in vitro, we performed qPCR analysis on DNA extracted from tissue of 23 western pearlshell specimens from 12 locations, as well as 23 nontarget mussel and fish species with which they co-occur ( We optimized primer concentrations (Table 2) in triplicate, 15μl reactions using the qPCR recipe above and varied concentrations of each primer (100, 300, 600, or 900 nM) for a total 16 unique combinations (Wilcox et al., 2015). Concentrations resulting in the earliest C t value and a high endpoint fluorescence relative to the most concentrated level tested were selected for all subsequent analyses (Table 2).
Using these optimized primer concentrations, we then performed a standard curve analysis to examine the sensitivity of the assay.
The qPCR product was purified using GeneJET PCR Purification Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) and quantified on a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scientific). A seven-level serial dilution (31 250, 6 250, 1 250, 250, 50, 10, and 2 copies per 4 μl) was created in sterile TE, and each level was analyzed in six replicates.
To validate the western pearlshell assay in vivo, we compiled western pearlshell occurrence data from the Middle and North Forks of the John Day River in Oregon (Brim Box et al., 2003, 2006) and from 16 streams in Montana and one in eastern Idaho (historical surveys; Stagliano, 2010Stagliano, , 2015)). Historical surveys were conducted using traditional techniques such as snorkeling, SCUBA, aquascopes, and direct observation in Oregon in 2003 (Brim Box et al., 2003), and Montana and Idaho between 2007 and 2014 (Stagliano, 2010(Stagliano, , 2015)). We mapped these historical surveys onto our archive of eDNA sampling surveys to look for adjacency or overlap among survey types. We found eDNA surveys conducted in 2015 and 2016 targeting bull trout, smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu, and Arctic grayling Thymallus arcticus were near historical western pearlshell surveys (Table 4).
Where sites from both surveys were overlapping or adjacent, we selected eDNA samples to re-analyze with the western pearlshell assay and assigned each sample an expectation of DNA presence. All of the eDNA samples from the Middle and North Forks of the John Day River were expected to be positive for western pearlshell DNA in accordance with abundant detection in historical surveys (Brim Box et al., 2003) and more recent incidental observations of high mussel densities (Erika Rubenson, University of Washington, personal communication). Additionally, eDNA samples from Musselshell Creek in Idaho and Trail Creek in Montana were expected positive based on historical surveys (Stagliano, 2010). Samples from nine streams in Montana were expected to be negative for western pearlshell DNA based on historical surveys (Stagliano, 2010; Table 4).
Overlap among survey types was also found in the West Fork Rock Creek, Montana (Figure 1). Here, extensive surveys based on traditional techniques for western pearlshell (2014) and on eDNA techniques for bull trout (2016) were independently conducted, and precise location data were available for both surveys (Stagliano, 2015;Young et al., 2017). In this area, we directly compared the results of these basin-level surveys.
All eDNA samples were collected following methods outlined in Carim, Dysthe, Young, McKelvey, and Schwartz (2016). Briefly, 5 l of water was pumped through a glass microfiber filter (pore size 1.5 μm) using a peristaltic pump, and the filter was stored in silica desiccant until extraction. DNA was extracted from each filter using the DNeasy T A B L E 4 Collection information for in vivo testing of the western pearlshell assay. All samples were collected during surveys for other taxa (see text). Expectation of western pearlshell presence was based on proximity to historical locations (Brim Box et al., 2003, 2006;Stagliano, 2010Stagliano, , 2015)). In the West Fork Rock Creek, all eDNA samples collected within the basin were analyzed for western pearlshell mussels to provide a formal comparison with basin-wide historical mussel surveys (Stagliano, 2010(Stagliano, , 2015; Figure 1). Site ID for the West Fork Rock Creek samples corresponds to sampling locations shown in Figure 1 Site  Tissue and Blood Kit (Qiagen, Inc) following a modified protocol (Carim, Dysthe, et al., 2016). All eDNA was extracted in a room dedicated solely to this practice, and extracts were stored at -20°C until analyzed. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate 15μl reactions containing 7.5 μl Environmental Master Mix 2.0 (Life Technologies), optimized primer concentrations (Table 2), 250 nM probe, a TaqMan Exogenous Internal Positive Control (Life Technologies) including 1.5 μl of 10× IPC assay and 0.30 μl of 50× IPC DNA, and the remainder with deionized water. A no-template control in which distilled water was substituted for DNA template was included in each analysis. For all qPCR experiments, a reaction was considered positive if the amplification curve crossed the assigned threshold during the exponential phase.

Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s11356-015-5754-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. Indeed, past studies indicated that model ecotoxicological organisms experimentally exposed to contaminants produce a distinctive pattern of gene transcription for each contaminant (Denslow et al. 2007;Poynton et al. 2008a, b).
European eels (Anguilla anguilla) are catadromous fish species with a complex life cycle including marine (sexual maturation, spawning, and larval phase) and continental (feeding and growth) environments. Historically abundant and widespread in Europe, the population of European eels has suffered a sharp decline (Haro et al. 2000;Wirth and Bernatchez 2003;Geeraerts and Belpaire 2010). The European species is currently considered as critically endangered of extinction by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Among hypotheses advanced to explain these declines, the possible contribution of pollution has received considerable attention in recent years. The unusual life cycle of European eels makes them particularly vulnerable to pollution (Belpaire and Goemans 2007;Geeraerts and Belpaire 2010). For these reasons, European eels could be considered as a sentinel species in ecotoxicology and as a model to explore recent hypotheses for which human activities have led to a tremendous decrease in aquatic biodiversity in the last century (Belpaire and Goemans 2007).
In a previous study (Baillon et al. 2015a), we used RNA-Seq technology on both the liver of European and American (Anguilla rostrata) eels. The main objective of that previous study was to discover without any a priori statistically confident Bcandidate genes' that are more likely related to contaminant exposure than to natural stressors. Other studies were carried out on wild European eels (Pujolar et al. 2012(Pujolar et al. , 2013)). During these studies, the hepatic transcriptome of eels from a clean site was compared with the hepatic transcriptome of eels from polluted sites by means of a DNA microarray. The results showed significant changes in the transcription level of genes involved in detoxification, in the fight against oxidative stress and in the general stress response (e.g., metallothioneins and heat shock proteins). These studies highlighted the potential of transcriptomic investigations in an ecotoxicological context. However, studies carried out on the liver are invasive and involve the sacrifice of animals. Due to the critically endangered status of the European eel species, the objective of this study was to test whether the caudal fin may be used to detect in situ exposure to contaminants by means of a 1000 candidate-gene microarray (Baillon et al. 2015b), developed from our previous RNA-Seq study.
Actually, teleost fish fin can regenerate within a few weeks after amputation (Santamaría and Becerra 1991;Poss et al. 2003;Schebesta et al. 2006), and the use and development of non-invasive methods in ecotoxicology appear to be highly relevant, especially for endangered species. Veldhoen and colleagues ( 2013) have already raised the potential of the caudal fin in ecotoxicological studies. In their study, rainbow trouts were experimentally exposed to cadmium (Cd) during 96 h and the transcription level of genes encoding for the metallothionein isoforms A and B, catalase, and aryl hydrocarbon receptor was analyzed by means of quantitative PCR analysis. Since significant changes in gene transcription levels were observed in their study, it appears interesting to further explore these findings and to investigate a wider and deeper transcriptomic response of the fin in animals exposed for longer periods in the laboratory as well as in wild animals, to test whether the fin may be used to detect the effects of contaminants on the transcriptome of wild contaminated fish.
In the present study, wild immature European yellow eels were captured along the Garonne-Gironde fluvio-estuary system (France) known to be polluted by Cd and polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) notably (Durrieu et al. 2005;Tapie et al. 2011). In addition, control individuals were captured in a clean site (Certes). For controlled laboratory exposures, eels were taken from the clean site (Certes) and were exposed during 45 days either to Cd or to a mixture of PCBs in order to mimic field exposure conditions. In order to assess the detection sensitivity of the fin, the transcription profiles from the caudal fin and liver of experimentally Cd-contaminated fish were compared. The liver was selected due to its wide range of functions, including metal detoxification and energy metabolism but also because (i) it represents an organ extensively studied in toxicology and (ii) it is a main site of Cd bioaccumulation and toxicity in fish (Gül et al. 2004;Gonzalez et al. 2006;van Dyk et al. 2007).

[SECTION] materials and methods

[SECTION] wild eel sample collection
Immature yellow eels (A. Anguilla) were collected in two contaminated sites along the Gironde aquatic system (Garonne: 44°43″51″N 0°28′05″O and Gironde estuary: 45°12′07″N 0°43′35″O) and in the Arcachon Bay, considered as a clean environment (Certes: 44°41′18″N 1°1′39″W). Temperature reached 21.4, 21.3, and 21.9 °C and salinity was 0.13, 7.78, and 19.9 ‰ for Garonne, Gironde, and Certes, respectively.
All fish were collected between May 24 and June 24, 2011, using a trawl or a fyke net. All immature female yellow eels were size selected to minimize potential allometric bias (Table 1). The stage of eels was assessed by measuring the ocular index (Pankhurst 1982). This index reached 4. 3±0.41 (mean±SE,n=10). For each sampling site, a total of five fish were collected and used for subsequent analyses. Live fish were held in a portable water basin filled with aerated water from the sampling site until they were weighed, measured, and sacrificed as soon as possible by decapitation. Samples for gene transcription analyses were stored in RNA later at -20 °C until needed. For both organic and metal analyses, samples were stored at -80 °C.

[SECTION] experimental design for laboratory exposures
All procedures used in this experiment were approved by the Aquitaine fish-birds ethics committee. Thirty-two immature yellow eels, averaging 37 cm in length and 70 g in weight (36.9±2.5 cm and 70.4±2.4 g, respectively, mean±SE, n=32, Table 1) were captured in Certes in May 2012. The animals were transferred to the laboratory (Marine Biology Station of Arcachon) and kept in running aerated brackish water (salinity 5 ‰, natural seawater dilution with aerated tap water) thermostated at 23 °C over a 1-month acclimation period, prior to experimentation. During this period, fish were fed every day with blue mussels, and no lethality was observed.
Laboratory exposures were performed in a flow-through system consisting of four separate 215-L experimental units (EU). One EU was used per experimental condition. Each tank was supplied with brackish water (salinity 5‰) by four water flow meters and contained eight organisms per tank. In order to maintain similar and constant physic-chemical conditions among the EUs, the four EUs were supplied with brackish water providing from a single reserve. Contaminant exposure was initiated after 1 month of adaptation to the experimental conditions. During the experiment (45 days), eels were fed every 2 days ad libitum (7.5 % wet weight of food per wet weight of fish per day) with artificial food (fresh fish flesh mixed with oil (1.3 %) and agar-agar (0.8 %)). For PCBs, the trophic route is known to be the major contamination route in fish (Loizeau and Menesguen 1993). In addition, in order to be close to in situ conditions, PCBs concentrations used in our experiments were based on the levels found in the prey of eels inhabiting the Gironde estuary (Tapie et al. 2011). For PCBs exposure, this food was enriched with pyralene to reach concentrations of 50 ng g -1 dry weight (dw) and 300 ng g -1 dw. The pyralene solution consisted of a mixture of PCB 28,52,101,118,138,153,and 180, the seven priority PCBs (US-EPA). For Cd exposure, animals were exposed to dissolved metal at a nominal concentration of 4 μg L -1 . Metal exposure was initiated by adding Cd as CdCl 2 from a stock solution in water. To maintain constant Cd contamination over time, contaminated tanks were fitted with a peristaltic pump which added Cd at the desired concentration. Due to technical limitations, the contamination level of Cd used in our experiment was higher than the concentration of dissolved Cd determined in the Gironde estuary (Cd∼0.1 μg L -1 ; Masson et al. 2006). Then, the average Cd concentrations were 0.09±0.01 μg L -1 and 4.00±0.18 μg L -1 (mean±SE, n=12) in control and contaminated tanks, respectively. Control animals were maintained in uncontaminated brackish water and fed with uncontaminated artificial food. During the exposure, the unconsumed food was removed every morning, dried, and weighed. For each EU, the dry weight of unconsumed food was subtracted from the total dry weight of given food to determine the percentage of food consumed, i.e., the food intake rate. Results are expressed as mean±SE (n=22). At the end of the exposure period, five eels per EU were removed and dissected. The total length and weight of eels were recorded for each fish in order to determine the Fulton condition factor (K= weight/length 3 ) and the hepato-somatic index (HSI=(liver weight/total weight) × 100). The liver was dissected and weighted. Samples of the liver and caudal fin were immediately fixed in RNA later solution and stored at -20 °C until needed for analyses. For both organic and metal analyses, samples were stored at -80 °C.

[SECTION] rna extraction, labeling and cdna hybridization
All procedures were carried out as previously described in Baillon et al. (2015b). Total RNA was extracted from the caudal fin and liver of the 20 experimental fish (5 individuals per condition, 5 uncontaminated (controls), 5 contaminated by PCBs at 50 ng g -1 and 300 ng g -1 , and 5 contaminated by Cd at 4 μg L -1 ) and a total of 15 wild fish from Certes, Gironde, and Garonne sampling sites (5 specimen per sampling site). RNAs were extracted from 15-25 mg of tissue using the SV total RNA isolation system (Promega) with minor modifications. Then, we used an indirect complementary DNA (cDNA) labeling method. In order to normalize microarray data, we used a common reference design. The reference was composed by pooling total RNA from the liver of 30 wild eels from the clean site; i.e., Certes (15 fish collected in 2011 and 15 in 2012). This reference was combined in equal amounts with each sample before hybridization on the microarray slide (15 h at 55 °C). A total of 40 microarrays were used as follows: 5 microarrays for the control condition, 10 for the Cd condition (5 for the fin and 5 for the liver), 5 for each PCB condition (i.e., 50 ng g -1 and 300 ng g -1 ), and 5 for each sampling site (i.e., Certes, Gironde, and Garonne). Each sample was hybridized once on cDNA microarray. Data acquisition was carried out by means of the Innoscan 710 microarray scanner (Innopsys) using Mapix software. More details on sample preparation and microarray processing are available in NCBI/Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under the accession number GPL19017.

[SECTION] metal and organic concentration analyses
For the laboratory Cd exposure, analyses were performed on water and liver samples following the procedures described by Pierron et al. (2007a). The detection limit was 0.1 μg L -1 Cd (0.018 μg g -1 of dry weight tissue). Metal concentrations in the liver were expressed as microgram per grams of dry weight tissue (dw). For Cd analyses in wild yellow eels, analyses were performed as follow. Liver samples were freeze-dried in PFA vials (Savillex) and kept in these vials during the whole digestion process. Samples were digested overnight at room temperature in pure trace metal grade nitric acid (HNO 3 ). The following day, sample digestion was completed by autoclave for 2 h at 15 PSI. Samples were then diluted in Milli-Q water to obtain a final concentration of 10 % HNO 3 . Metal concentrations were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS; Thermo Scientific XSeries 2). Blanks and standards (TORT-2 and DOLT-4, National Research Council Canada) were submitted to the same digestion protocol as liver samples to monitor the efficiency of the procedure. Recovery rate (expressed as % of certified values) was 102.9± 1.2 %.
Analysis of the seven indicator PCBs (CB28 (+50), CB52, CB101, CB118, CB138, CB153, and CB180), for wild and experimental animals, were performed on muscle samples following the procedures described by Tapie et al. (2008Tapie et al. ( , 2011)). PCB analyses were carried out on an HP 5890 series II gas chromatograph from Hewlett-Packard (Avondale, CA, USA) coupled to a 63 Ni electron capture detector (ECD). A capillary column HP5-MS (Agilent Technologies, Massy, France) was used (30 m×0.25 mm×0.25 μm). For PCBs, LoQs were comprised between 0.2 ng g -1 dw and 2 ng g -1 dw. Results are presented as the sum of the seven PCB concentrations.

[SECTION] data acquisition and analysis
Concerning contaminant analyses and morphometric data, comparisons among fish groups were performed by analysis of variance (ANOVA), after checking assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity of the error terms. The least square deviation test (LSD) was used to determine whether means between pairs of samples were significantly different from one another. When assumptions were not met, we used the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test. Computations were performed using the statistical software Sigma Stat.
Concerning microarrays, the filtering of raw data was done for both green and red channels. The median foreground (F635median and F532median) and median background (B635median and B532median) were used. If the ratio Fmedian/Bmedian was lower than 1.5, data were removed from the analysis. In addition, data from bad replicate spots (three spots for each probe) were excluded from the data set. For each spot, the background was removed of the foreground and the mean of triplicates was then calculated. Finally, both green and red channels were used for data normalization. Normalization and statistical analysis were done by using the BRB-arrayTools version 4.4.0 software package (http://linus. nci.nih.gov/BRB-ArrayTools.html). Each array was mediannormalized over entire arrays, and genes were excluded if 50 % of values were missing in the complete set of arrays (microarray data have been deposited on the NCBI/Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) platform under accession number GSE62954. In order to detect differences in transcription profiles among the conditions, data were analyzed by means of the class comparison test available in the BRB software which is similar to the statistical analysis of microarrays (SAM) method but provides greater probabilistic control of the false discovery rate. In addition, cluster analyses were conducted on normalized microarray data to search for natural groupings in the profiles. For clustering analyses, an average linkage hierarchical clustering was done with centered correlation using all arrays. Cluster significance and robustness of the dendrogram were examined by the method of Mcshane et al. (2002) based on 1000 permutations.

[SECTION] conditions and level of contamination
Morphometric measurements and condition indices of eels from the field and laboratory as well as food intake rates of laboratory eels are presented in Table 1. Wild eels (Certes, Gironde, and Garonne) and eels exposed to the PCB low condition (contaminated food at 50 ng g -1 ) presented a significant higher condition factor than controls, Cd-exposed eels or eels exposed to the PCB high condition (contaminated food at 300 ng g -1 ). In addition, the lowest HSI was observed for the eels exposed to the highest PCB exposure condition (300 ng g -1 ), whereas the highest value was observed for eels from Certes (i.e., the cleanest site). We must add that wild eels were significantly larger than laboratory-exposed eels. Only eels exposed to the low PCB condition did not show significant difference in terms of weight with eels from Garonne (i.e., the smallest individuals among wild eels). Concerning experimental exposures, a significant bioaccumulation of Cd was observed after 45 days of exposure to dissolved Cd at 4 μg L -1 . Eels experimentally exposed to Cd presented a significantly higher hepatic concentration of Cd than controls (Fig. 1a). Surprisingly, even if eels fed with PCB-contaminated food at 50 ng g -1 were fed with a food six times less contaminated than eels fed with PCB-contaminated food at 300 ng g -1 , the concentration of PCBs in the muscle of fish exposed to the lowest concentration was significantly 2.5 times higher than in eels exposed to the highest concentration of exposure (Fig. 1b). To clarify the discussion, throughout the manuscript, experimental conditions were named accordingly to the concentrations of PCBs determined in the animals. Then, PCB_170 refers to animals that were fed with a food contaminated in PCBs at a nominal concentration of at 50 ng g -1 and PCB_69 to animals that were fed with a food contaminated at 300 ng g -1 . The higher bioaccumulation observed in fish fed with the lowest contaminated food could be explained by the low food intake rate of animals exposed to PCB_69 (Table 1). Indeed, for the PCB_69 condition, eels ate significantly less food in comparison to controls and fish of the PCB_170 condition (Table 1). As PCB contamination was carried out by the trophic route, it likely explains, at least in part, the low level of PCBs in eels exposed to the highest contamination pressure. Nevertheless, our results agree with studies carried out on zebrafish where exposure to low levels of orally administrated PCBs was associated with no or, even, significant positive effects on fish growth and HSI, whereas high levels of exposure were on the contrary associated with negative impacts on these indices (Hashmi et al. 2015;Örn et al. 1998). However, the food intake rate was not followed during these studies. Our results suggest that these effects could be explained, at least in part, to food aversion at high PCB concentrations. Finally, the amount of PCBs was twice as high in fish exposed to PCB_170 in comparison to controls. We must note that despite no significant difference was observed between controls and fish exposed to PCB_170 (Fig. 1B) when all data are considered (i.e., both experimental and field data), this difference was highly significant (ANOVA, LSD, P=0.003617) when laboratory conditions are analyzed apart, i.e., when data from wild Fig. 1 Mean hepatic Cd (μg g -1 dw) (a) and muscle PCBs (ng g -1 dw, sum of the seven indicator PCBs) (b) concentrations in controls, in fish experimentally exposed to dissolved Cd at 4 μg L -1 (Cd_4) or to PCBscontaminated food at two concentrations (PCB_170, PCB_ 69 for 50 ng g -1 and 300 ng g -1 , respectively) and in wild animals (Certes, Garonne, Gironde). Results are expressed as mean± SE (n=5). Means designated with different letters are significantly different (LSD test, P<0.05) animals were removed from the analysis. Eels the PCBs_170 condition were significantly more contaminated in comparison to controls.
Concerning in situ investigations, wild eels from Gironde were significantly more contaminated by Cd than fish from Certes and Garonne (Fig. 1A). For PCBs, fish from Garonne and Gironde appeared to be significantly more contaminated than fish from Certes (Fig. 1B), confirming that Certes was a good reference site in terms of contamination. However, we observed a high variability in PCB concentrations in eels from Garonne with contamination levels ranging from 56 to 5342 ng g -1 with a median value reaching 952 ng g -1 (mean=1587 ng g -1 ). For comparison, contamination levels in eels from Gironde ranged from 1454 to 2052 ng g -1 with a median value reaching 1611 ng g -1 (mean=1641 ng g -1 ).
The comparisons among contamination levels of wild and laboratory eels showed that Certes and control eels presented similar values for both Cd and PCBs. This is in agreement to the fact that control eels were initially sampled in the Certes site. For Cd, wild eels from Garonne and the experimental Cd_4 condition did not differ significantly. However, wild fish from Gironde showed significantly higher contamination levels in both Cd and PCBs in comparison to fish from the experimental exposure conditions. The fact that the concentrations in PCBs and Cd in eels experimentally exposed during 45 days to PCBs and Cd were significantly lower than in wild eels tends to show that a 45-day period of experimental exposure was not sufficient to mimic several years of in situ chronic exposure.

[SECTION] fin transcriptomic responses

[SECTION] fin transcriptomic response to experimental cd and pcb exposures
Firstly, in order to assess the detection sensitivity of the caudal fin, we investigated if the transcriptomic response of this tissue in response to Cd exposure could be comparable to that one developed by the liver. We thus compared the transcriptomic profiles of the liver and fin of fish experimentally exposed to Cd. First, statistical analyses were carried out to identify genes that were differentially transcribed in the two organs between the five controls and the five animals exposed to Cd contamination. Seventy-two genes and 77 genes were differentially transcribed (described in SI in table S1 andS2) in the caudal fin and the liver, respectively. Thus, the number of genes that were differentially transcribed in response to Cd exposure was equivalent in the two tissues, highlighting the detection sensitivity of the caudal fin in detecting the exposure to Cd. As in the vast majority of cases when the transcriptomic responses of different tissues are compared, the most of the genes affected by Cd were different between the two tissues and only 16 genes were shared between the two lists of differentially transcribed genes. In addition, only nine genes were affected in the same direction (up-or downregulation) in the two tissues.
Considering the sensibility of the caudal fin to detect Cd exposure, we then tested if caudal fin clips could be used to detect specifically a recent exposure to a particular contaminant. In this aim, statistical analyses were carried out to identify the genes that were differentially transcribed in the fin among experimental exposure conditions, i.e., Cd_4, PCB_69 and PCB_170, and controls. The Venn diagram (Fig. 2) presents the overlap of differentially transcribed genes for the three experimental conditions. The differentially transcribed genes were distributed as follows: 40 genes were only affected by Cd, 75 by PCB_170, and 11 by PCB_69. The corresponding gene lists for Cd_4, PCB_170, and PCB_69 are described in the supplementary material (Table S1, S3, andS4). The transcription level of several genes was modified by two conditions. Specifically, 21 genes were significantly affected in both Cd_4 and PCB_170 conditions, 5 genes were significantly affected by both Cd_4 and PCB_69, and 4 genes were significantly affected by both PCB_170 and PCB_69. The transcription level of only six genes was affected by all three experimental conditions.
Thus, most of the differentially transcribed genes were different from one experimental condition to another. The number of genes differentially transcribed in response to PCB exposure was higher in fish from the PCB_170 condition in comparison to fish of the PCB_69 condition, i.e., the response Fig. 2 Venn diagram presenting the number of differentially transcribed genes among fish experimentally exposed to PCB_170 (food at 50 ng g -1 ), PCB_69 (food at 300 ng g -1 ), and Cd_4 (dissolved metal at 4 μg L -1 ). Intersection regions correspond to differentially transcribed genes that were common among the experiments was higher in fish exposed to the lower of exposure. As evoked this can be explained by the fact that eels exposed to the PCB_69 condition were significantly less contaminated than fish of the PCB_170 condition. The mechanisms by which contaminants can affect the fin transcriptome remain to be elucidated. We must note that in the particular case of Cd, in addition to internal redistribution, a direct effect of the metal on the caudal fin cannot be ruled out as the contamination was carried out by the direct route (i.e., dissolved metal in water).

[SECTION] comparison of the transcriptomic profiles obtained from the fin of wild-and laboratory-exposed fish
As the caudal fin seemed to show a great potential to detect and discriminate exposure to contaminants during experimental investigations, it was interesting to test whether the fin can be used to detect and separate the specific effects of contaminants on the transcriptome of wild animals. After performing microarray hybridizations, a hierarchical clustering was performed with data obtained from both experimental and wild eels to assess the similarities and dissimilarities among the transcription profiles. First, the dendrogram generated from this analysis (Fig. 3) was divided into four clusters with reproducibility indices for the four groups reaching 0.808, 0.964, 1, and 0.671, respectively (R-index=0.876 and D-index=2.57), which indicates reasonably robust clusters (Mc Shane et al. 2002). The first cluster included only laboratory conditions; three control fish, four PCB_69, and one eel of the Cd_4 condition. The second one included eels from Certes and Garonne and one fish from PCB_69 condition. The third one included all eels of the PCB_170 condition and all eels from Gironde. The fourth one included four fish experimentally exposed to Cd (Cd_4) and two control organisms (Fig. 3). Even if four animals were not clustered within their respective condition (one Cd_4, two controls, and one PCB_69), the transcription profiles of the caudal fin seemed to be able to discriminate fish from each in situ and laboratory condition.
Concerning controls, they were not grouped together but associated with PCB_69 (cluster 1) and animals from Cd_4 condition (cluster 4). Thus, a higher variation was observed among control individuals in comparison to the animals from the other conditions. As described by Devin et al. (2014), sublethal exposure to contaminant can lead to a decrease in interindividual variability and to a canalization of the response to the most efficient one in animals presenting a high phenotypic variability. European eel is indeed a panmictic species that exhibits extreme inter-individual phenotypic variance among teleost fish (Pujolar et al. 2014). In addition, the fact that controls were associated with fish from the PCB_69 condition in the cluster 1 could be explained by the amount of PCB accumulated in the muscle of fish from the PCB_69 condition (discussed earlier). Concentrations of PCBs in these fish were closed to controls and then PCB_69 and control fish showed some similar transcriptomic patterns (only 26 genes were differentially transcribed between controls and PCB_69, Fig. 3 and Table S4). Concerning the transcriptomic profile differences observed between controls and wild animals from Certes (clusters 1 and 2), although all of these animals came from the Certes site, they were not grouped together. This could be explained by experimental conditions. For example, animals were Fig. 3 Hierarchical clustering of fin transcriptomic profiles of controls (Ctl), fish experimentally exposed to dissolved Cd at 4 μg L -1 (Cd_4) or PCBs-contaminated food at two concentrations (PCB_170, PCB_69 for 50 ng g -1 and 300 ng g -1 , respectively), and wild eels (Certes, Garonne, Gironde). Clustering was performed using the entire set of genes using the BRB Array tool software and based on means of average linkage clustering and centered correlation maintained in the laboratory at a lower salinity (5 versus 19.9 ‰ in the site) and were fed ad libitum. the confinement of wild animals in EU may have certainly an impact on the transcriptome of animals (Calduch-Giner et al. 2010;Terova et al. 2011;Liu et al. 2014).
Regarding the fact that fish from Gironde clustered with fish experimentally exposed to PCB_170 (cluster 3) suggests that the fin transcriptomic response offers the possibility to predict the presence of a specific toxicant in a field sample. However, it must be noted that whereas fish from Garonne were highly contaminated by PCBs, their transcription profiles did not cluster with fish experimentally exposed to PCBs_170 or Gironde. As mentioned earlier, this could be due, at least in part, to the fact that a high variability was observed in the PCB contamination levels of fish from Garonne. In addition, we must note that fish from Garonne were more closely associated with fish from Certes. This could be explained by their low levels of Cd contamination in comparison to fish from Gironde. Indeed, a lower but significant relationship was observed between fish from Gironde and fish experimentally exposed to Cd (clusters 3 and 4). Here, it is noteworthy that the PCB concentrations used in our experiments were based on the levels found in the prey of eels inhabiting the Gironde estuary (Tapie et al. 2011). In contrast, due to technical limitations, the contamination level of Cd used in our experiment appears to be quite high in comparison to the concentration determined in the Gironde estuary (Cd∼0.1 μg L -1 ; Masson et al. 2006). In addition, a previous study showed that Cd contamination by food also plays a nonnegligible role in the Cd contamination of wild eels inhabiting the Garonne-Gironde continuum (Pierron et al. 2008). This could partly explain why the responses obtained in fish from Gironde clustered with those obtained in fish experimentally exposed to PCB_170 (i.e., cluster 3) and to a lesser extent with fish exposed to Cd_4 (i.e., cluster 4).
In order to deepen these results, the genes that were commonly affected in fish from Gironde (i.e., the most contaminated site) and in fish experimentally exposed to PCB_170 or Cd_4 were identified. To do this, genes that were differentially transcribed between fish from Gironde and control animals were identified. A total of 93 genes were found (Table S5). These genes were compared to those that were differentially transcribed between controls and fish exposed to Cd_4 or PCB_170. The differentially transcribed genes were distributed as follows: 19 genes were commonly affected in Cd and Gironde, 37 in PCB_170 and Gironde (Table S6 andS7), and 9 were commonly affected in all three conditions. When only the genes that were affected in the same direction (i.e., up-or downregulation) between the conditions were considered, the distribution was as follows: 9 genes were commonly affected in Cd and Gironde, 25 in PCB_170 and Gironde, and 6 were commonly affected in all three conditions. Among the 19 genes that were commonly and specifically affected in Gironde and PCB_170 (i.e., not by Cd), 6 genes (plxna3, irch3, foxa1-a, mafb, sh3gl3, and bcor) encode for proteins involved in development and, for most of them, in nervous system development. The genes plxNA3 and lrch3 are involved in nervous system development (Cheng et al. 2001;Chen et al. 2006) and were upregulated (Table S7). In contrast, the genes bcor and sh3gl3 that are also involved in nervous system development (Wamstad and Bardwell 2007) were downregulated. Such results are in accordance with the wellknown neurotoxicity and developmental effects of PCBs (Faroon et al. 2000;Berg et al. 2011). Concerning the gene sh3gl3, this gene encodes for a protein that is colocalized with microtubules in the cell and has a role in transport along or as part of the structure of microtubules (Hughes et al. 2004). Interestingly, two other genes involved in microtubule dynamics were also affected. The gene katnal1 encodes for a protein involves in microtubule severing/degradation (Ghosh et al. 2012) and was upregulated. The gene kif21a codes for a microtubule-dependent motor protein involved in the transport of cellular components along axonal and dendritic microtubules (Marszalek et al. 1999). This gene was downregulated. The upregulation of a gene involved in microtubule degradation may be in accordance with the downregulation of genes involved in the transport along microtubules. Such results are also in accordance with results obtained in mice exposed to low levels of PCBs. PCB exposure triggered changes in the transcription levels of genes involved in microtubule cytoskeleton organization. In addition, this was associated with microtubule reorganization in the brain of PCB-contaminated mice (Elnar et al. 2015).
Only three genes were commonly and specifically affected in the same direction in fish from Gironde and Cd_4 condition. First, the tpm3 gene was downregulated. This gene codes for protein that is involved in stabilizing cytoskeleton actin filaments in non-muscle cells (Armstrong et al. 2007). Cd exposure is indeed known to disrupt the integrity of the cytoskeleton by acting on actin filaments (Gómez-Mendikute and Cajaraville 2003; Apostolova et al. 2006;Williams et al. 2006). The two other genes were upregulated. The gene rras2 encodes a protein that transduces growth inhibitory signals across the cell membrane. Such a result is in accordance with our previous work (Baillon et al. 2015a). Genes involved in cell cycle arrest or in the inhibition of cell proliferation were upregulated in the liver of wild Cd-contaminated yellow eels. Finally, the gene slc39a6 codes for a zinc influx ion transmembrane transporter. Many studies have already shown that Cd exposure disrupts zinc homeostasis by increasing the transcription level of zinc transporters and zinc accumulation in the cell (Noel et al. 2006;Chouchene et al. 2011;Tang et al. 2013).
Finally, we also investigated the genes that were commonly affected by Cd, PCB-170, and Gironde, and six genes were found. Among these genes, the gene eed was upregulated. This gene encodes a member of the polycomb-group (PcG) protein family that is a component of the PRC2/EED-EZH2 complex. This complex methylates lysine residues of histones H3, leading to transcriptional repression of the target gene.
complex also serves as a recruiting platform DNA methyltranferases, linking two repression mechanisms (Viré et al. 2006). It is noteworthy that exposure to dissolved Cd at 4 μg L -1 was previously found to trigger a significant increase in the global DNA methylation level in the liver of eels (Pierron et al. 2014). The upregulated gene amacr encodes for a protein that is involved in fatty acid β-oxidation (Wanders 2004). This is in agreement with a previous study carried out on yellow eels exposed to dissolved Cd at 5 μg L -1 . Cd-contaminated eels showed a lower efficiency of lipid storage compared to controls. This effect was explained by an increased utilization of lipid reserves in Cdcontaminated eels (Pierron et al. 2007a). Finally, among the downregulated genes, the mt-nd5 gene encodes for a subunit of the complex I of the respiratory chain. In a previous genome-wide transcriptome analysis carried out on wild premigrating European eels contaminated by PCBs, organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs) Pujolar et al. (2012Pujolar et al. ( , 2013)), also reported a downregulation of the mt-nd5 gene in the liver of fish inhabiting highly polluted sites (Pujolar et al. 2012(Pujolar et al. , 2013)). Moreover, a downregulation of the mt-nd5 gene was also reported in the gills of glass eels experimentally exposed to dissolved Cd as well as in gonads of female silver eels pre-exposed to Cd (Pierron et al. 2007b(Pierron et al. , 2009)).
